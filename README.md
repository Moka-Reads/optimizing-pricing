# üìò Pricing Optimization for Multi-Format Publishing

This project provides a mathematical and computational framework for **optimizing the price structure** of published works (ebooks, paperbacks, retail, etc.) across different distribution channels with varying royalty margins.

## üîç Problem Summary

Given:
- A set of \( n \) sales platforms (e.g., Ebook Direct, KDP Paperback, Retail)
- Known **royalty margins** \( m_i \in [0, 1] \) for each platform
- Acceptable **price bounds** \( [\underline{p}_i, \overline{p}_i] \) per platform

We want to **choose prices** \( p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n \) such that:
- Prices follow a natural increasing order:
  \[
  p_1 < p_2 < \dots < p_n
  \]
- Royalties per unit favor high-margin platforms:
  \[
  m_1 p_1 \geq m_2 p_2 \geq \dots \geq m_n p_n
  \]
- The **total royalty per unit** is maximized:
  \[
  \max \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i p_i
  \]

## üìä Output

The script returns a ranked summary table showing:
- Optimal price for each platform
- Per-unit royalty (your earnings)
- A ‚Äúsupport ranking‚Äù showing which format benefits you most

## üßÆ Mathematical Formulation (LaTeX)

See `problem.typ` for the full write-up, including constraints, objective, and rationale.

## üêç Code Usage

Install required Python packages:

```bash
uv sync
```

Run the optimizer:

```python
from optimizer import optimize_pricing

platforms = [
    {'name': 'Ebook (Direct)', 'margin': 0.95},
    {'name': 'Paperback (KDP)', 'margin': 0.55},
    {'name': 'Retail (Ingram)', 'margin': 0.35},
]

bounds = [(5, 20), (10, 30), (15, 40)]

result = optimize_pricing(platforms, bounds)
print(result)
# to save csv:
# result.to_csv('summary.csv', index=False)
```
